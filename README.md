Program alumni job placements. View on RPubs here: https://rpubs.com/brianrice/msia-jobs

As I look for an internship, I recognize that referrals can be very valuable. So I put together a simple flexdashboard to show where the program alumni end up. Information is published on the [program website](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/analytics/people/alumni/) and organized by cohort, so this dashboard combines all available cohort data.
